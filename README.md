# CS305_ArtemisFinancial-



Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a finance company looking for a surcurity expert to help make their company more sercure for their clients theirselves as a company. Thier client is Global Rain enterprise. They asked to have a file verification step added to their web application to ensure sercure communications between client and server. 


What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I feel like I did the checksum and dependencies very well. There is a lot that goes into taking these types of sercurity measures and we have to make sure that they are investigated properly. The importance of coding sercurely is becuase hackers are hacking into systems consantly and makeing sure that your web applications are afe from such threats is very important to the client as well as the server. I recommend always having some type of sercurity when developing anything using code. Your personal information is online and very easy to get ahold of if the proper sercurity measures are over looked. 


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The checksum was very helpful. After conducting that type of checkm I understood what goes into it and why it has to be done. 


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Using a hash function created the best sercurity for the project at Artemis. In the future I would use the same techniques as we used here in this course.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I first checked for the voulnerbilities and then I also checked to see if there were any hidden supresses that we could not see at first. 


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used maiinly a wode range of research to get the proper instruction for this class and the project. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would of course show the refactored code that introduced the hash functions. I would also show the volnerbility test that took place to ensure sercurity.
